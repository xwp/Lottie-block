# Lottie custom block

This block allows the user to add Lottie JSON animation https://lottiefiles.com/. It is a lightweight animation defined in JSON form. Using the editor view, the user is able to define how will the animation be displayed on the website by changing configuring it in the editor sidebar.

In order to use it, the Lottie player script must be enqueued. This block is tested with https://unpkg.com/@lottiefiles/lottie-player@1.5.4/dist/lottie-player.js.

## Block properties

- Block name: *create-block/lottiee*
- Child or parent blocks: *none*
## Block settings

OnceÂ the 'Lottie' custom block is added to the editor view, the user will be able to adjust how will the animation be displayed in the right sidebar. The list of available options is detailed in the text below.
- *Autoplay* - Allows starting animation on page load.
- *Controls* - Allows the use of animation player controls. With it, the user can play, pause or stop the animation.
- *Loop* - Allows repeating animation after it is finished. Turning off this option will play animation only once.
